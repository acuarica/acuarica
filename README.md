## About

I have worked for more than 10 years in private industry in different roles, as Software Developer, Software Engineer, Network Administrator and Freelance Developer.

I have a Ph.D. in Informatics at the UniversitÃ  della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland.
The topic of my Ph.D. was empirical studies on programming languages.
Its main goal was to understand how and why programming features are being used in the wild.
