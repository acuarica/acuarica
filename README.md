### Hi there, this is a **WIP** ðŸ‘‹

## About

I have a Ph.D. in Informatics at the UniversitÃ  della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland.
The topic of my Ph.D. was empirical studies on programming languages.
Its main goal was to understand how and why programming features are being used in the wild.
Since any empirical study on programming languages must be language-dependent, we focus on **Java**.

In the past, my research interests included functional programming--mostly in Haskell--, static analysis, and program transformation with Supercompilation.

Before Supercompilation, I have developed JNIF, a Java Class Files parser to be used as a native agent using JVMTI.

I worked under the advise of Prof. Matthias Hauswirth and Prof. Nate Nystrom.
I have worked for more than 10 years in private industry in different roles, as Software Developer, Software Engineer, Network Administrator and Freelance Developer.
Master in Computer Science from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Also Teaching Experience as Teaching Assistant in both USI and University of Buenos Aires.
